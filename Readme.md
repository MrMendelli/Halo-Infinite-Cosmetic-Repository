**Halo Infinite Cosmetic Repository**

An indexed and sorted repository of Halo Infinite cosmetic unlock images.

This repository is for research purposes, and to get a glimpse at upcoming, unused, or unlisted cosmetic content for Halo Infinite.

All files included use their original file names, they are located here:

`<Gameroot>\package\pc\common\gamecms`

These files don't have extensions, I used [TrID](https://mark0.net/soft-trid-e.html) to verify the file magic of the contents and used this command to append the extensions to them:

`ren * *.png`
_(*Note that not all files in this directory are images. The other files seem to be linking information of some sort. These files will not be included in this repository.)_

**Notes:**

- _Not all items that are available have an associated image, this has me questioning why these files are here, and if the locations of new items are local to the client-side disk or if they are now cached on runtime._

I will update this as often as I can, see the log files in `[Snapshots]` for the game version number and date each was captured at. I will periodically generate new snapshots to compare and see if new content is added. I share no affiliation with the Microsoft Corporation, Xbox Game Studios, or 343 Industries.
